my solutions to project euler problems

**3.c**
- 3best.c is much more simple, but I wanted to try my hand at generating primes so I did it the long way

**5.c**
- this is just asking for the least common multiple of 1-20, would be quicker on paper than writing the code

**7.c**
- used sieve of eratosthenes after looking it up. much more refined prime generation than what I use in 3.c
